# Project Overview
For this project, my group and I utilized reinforcement learning techniques to teach an AI model how to play Pac-Man. We used the Gymnasium package for the Pac-Man environment, Stable Baseline's Deep Q Network for the agent to learn actions and rewards, and a Convolutional Neural Network for the agent to view the game as it is played. Due to computational limitations, we trained the model at only 350,000 steps (versus the millions of steps required for flawless performance).

## Files
In this folder, you will find the ipynb file where the DQN model was trained (1), the script used to show the model playing in real time (2), and the slides used in our final presentation (3).
