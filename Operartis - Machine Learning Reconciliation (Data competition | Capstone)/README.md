# Project Overview
At the end of my master's degree, I completed a capstone project for Operartis, a New York city fintech company, that involved developing a machine learning model to perform automatic transaction matching. Prior to creating the model, much time was spent on the data preparation/transformation phase, where I developed custom indexing and comparison functions to best prepare the data for classification.
