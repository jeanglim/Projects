# Project Overview
The Virginia Datathon is a yearly statewide competition focused around a central theme. This year, we were tasked with finding ways to boost the Virginia workforce. Over the course of a week, we used 8 datasets from the Virginia Open Data Portal to extract the most useful features in predicting labor force participation. We were selected as **finalists** and won the **People's Choice Award** at the in-person conference in Richmond, VA.
