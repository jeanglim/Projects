For this project, I utilized Spotify data to create a Tableau dashboard detailing the music theory behind the most streamed songs of 2023.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/top-spotify-songs-2023?resource=download

NOTE: If you download the twbx file, the filters corresponding to the keys could render strangely. The png file shows how the circle of fifths would look if Tableau was consistent across machines.
