# Project Overview
For this project, I utilized Spotify data to create an interactive **Tableau** dashboard detailing the music theory behind the most streamed songs of 2023.

## Files
In this folder, you will find a screenshot of the final dashboard (1), the packaged Tableau file of the dashboard (2), and the slides used to present the dashboard (3).

3. SpotifyPresentation.pdf

NOTE: If you download the twbx file, the filters corresponding to the keys could render strangely. The png file shows how the circle of fifths would look if Tableau was consistent across machines.
