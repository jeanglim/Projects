# Project Overview
During the summer of 2021, I was given a $3,000 Monroe Scholars grant to pursue a research topic of my choosing. I chose to study how evolutionary psychology can be applied to the courtroom, particularly in the way judges express anger. I presented my final paper at the Spring Undergraduate Research Symposium.
