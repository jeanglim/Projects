# H Mart Grocery Store Analysis
## Overview
For this project, I joined two datasets from the Virginia Open Data Portal to find the best counties for H Mart, an Asian grocery store chain, to open a new store. 
First, I loaded, transformed, and merged the data in **Alteryx**. I then loaded the data into a custom data warehouse in **SQL**. **Tableau** was used at the end to visualize the best counties for H Mart to explore.
